          <p>
            A data portal for volume electron microscopy datasets and
            accompanying segmentations available for exploration.
          </p>
          <p>
          Many of the datasets hosted here were acquired with the enhanced focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM)
          technology developed at Janelia. Accompanying many of these EM volumes are automated segmentations and analyses of intracellular sub-structures.
          </p>
