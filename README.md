COSEM Data portal (OpenOrganelle)

This app provides a gateway for visualization of large cloud-hosted FIB-SEM datasets via [neuroglancer](www.github.com/google/neuroglancer).

### Bucket configuration

The bucket hosting the datasets must have the proper configuration in order for this app to parse the contents of the bucket, and in order for neuroglancer to display arrays stored in the bucket.
Specifically, the following bucket policy (or a more permissive one) must be used, where $BUCKET is the name of the bucket hosting the data, e.g. `janelia-cosem-datasets-dev`: 

```json
{
    "Version": "2008-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": [
                "s3:List*",
                "s3:Get*"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::$BUCKET/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::$BUCKET"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

Additionally, the bucket must be configured for cross-origin requests (CORS), e.g. via the following bucket CORS configuration: 

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
<CORSRule>
    <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
    <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
    <AllowedMethod>HEAD</AllowedMethod>
    <MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
    <AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
</CORSRule>
</CORSConfiguration>

```

# Deployment

To deploy to dev run the deploy command without any additional arguments
```
npm run deploy
```
To deploy to production or the validation server pass in the stage as well, eg:
```
npm run deploy -- --stage val
```

# React App Stuff

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
